==Notes==
[[Image:Healing Signet Beta Icon.jpg|thumb|64px|Beta icon]]
*"-40 armor" will result in taking double damage from skills that are affected by [[armor rating]].
*[[Hero]]es and [[henchmen]] with this skill will retreat from combat in order to use it.
*The "-40 armor" is factored in after the [[Effect_stacking|armor cap]]. 

{{Anomaly|Despite the skill description, this skill heals rather than giving health gain.}}

==Trivia==
*In the early days of Guildwars, Healing Signet was planned to be a [[List of common skills|Common skill]] ''(thus the colorless beta icon)''.
